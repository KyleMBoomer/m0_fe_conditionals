# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Much more so than before this exercise. Got a long way to go.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I feel good about them. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Each time I have success with one, it builds confidence. Feeling confident!
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
I spent the most time on the comparisons, but all in all it came out to about an hour and change. A little over what I estimated.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I plan on budgeting time to review every concept covered in Mod 0 before Mod 1. So everything will go in the calendar. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I have no questions about this concept. It seems clear in my mind.
